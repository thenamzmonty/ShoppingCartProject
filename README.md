# ShoppingCartProject

## Project Overview
This Java project implements a `ShoppingCart` class that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping basket.  
Special offers are implemented:

- Apples: £0.35 each
- Bananas: £0.20 each
- Melons: £0.50 each, Buy One Get One Free
- Limes: £0.15 each, Three for the price of two

Unit tests are included using **JUnit 4.13.2**, covering:

- Single items
- Multiple items
- Special offers (BOGO, 3-for-2)
- Mixed baskets
- Edge cases (empty baskets, unknown items, large quantities)

Exception testing uses the **JUnit 4 style** with `@Test(expected = …)`.
